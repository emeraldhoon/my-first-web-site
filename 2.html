    <h1>CSS</h1>
    <p>
        Cascading Style sheets (css) is a style sheet 
        language used for describing the presentation
        of a document written in a markup language. [1] 
        Although most often used to set the visual 
        style of web pages and user interfaces written
        in HTML and XHTML, the language cna be applied 
        to any XML document, including plain XML, SBG 
        and SUL, and is applicable to rendering in 
        speech, or on other media. Along with HTML and 
        JavaScript, Css is a cornerstone technology 
        used by most websites to create visually 
        engaging webpages, user interfaces for web 
        applications, and uwer interfaces for many 
        mobile applications.
